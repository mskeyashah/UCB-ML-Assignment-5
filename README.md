Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/mskeyashah/UCB-ML-Assignment-5/blob/main/prompt.ipynb
## Overview
This report provides a summary of the analysis conducted on the acceptance of coffee house and bar coupons. The data was collected via a survey and includes various attributes such as age, income, weather, and more. The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns and characteristics of customers who are more likely to accept these coupons.

## Key Findings
### Coffee House Coupons
Time of Day: Coupons offered at 10 AM have a higher acceptance rate compared to those offered at 2 PM and 6 PM. This suggests that morning is a popular time for getting coffee and starting your day.

Frequent Visitors: Individuals who visit coffee houses frequently (more than 4 times a month) are significantly more likely to accept coffee house coupons. This indicates that habitual coffee drinkers see more value in the coupons.

Age Influence: Younger age groups, particularly those between 21 to 30 years, show a higher acceptance rate for coffee house coupons. This could be due to lifestyle preferences that include frequent coffee outings.

Passenger Influence: Drivers with children as passengers are less likely to accept coffee house coupons, possibly due to the inconvenience of stopping at a coffee house with children in the car.

Temperature Influence: Coupons offered when the temperature is 80Â°F have a higher acceptance rate, suggesting that warmer weather might encourage more coffee outings.

#### Combination Analysis:

Frequent Coffee Visitors & Age 21-30: Acceptance rate is 66%.

Single & Frequent Coffee Visitors: Acceptance rate is 68%.

High Temperature & Frequent Coffee Visitors: Acceptance rate is 73%.

Frequent Coffee Visitors with Sunny Weather: Acceptance rate is 70%

### Bar Coupons

Frequent Bar Visitors: Drivers who visit bars more frequently (more than 3 times a month) are more likely to accept bar coupons. This suggests that regular bar-goers find more value in these offers.

Age Factor: Drivers over the age of 25 are more likely to accept bar coupons, possibly due to social habits that align with bar visits.

Passenger Influence: Drivers without children as passengers are more inclined to use bar coupons, as bars are not typically seen as family-friendly venues.

Marital Status: Non-widowed individuals are more receptive to bar coupons, possibly due to more active social lives.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that lifestyle factors, social habits, demographic characteristics, and environmental conditions like temperature significantly influence the likelihood of accepting both coffee house and bar coupons. By understanding these patterns, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to target the most receptive audiences, thereby increasing the effectiveness of their coupon campaigns.

## Recommendations

Target Younger Demographics: Focus marketing efforts for coffee house coupons on younger age groups, particularly those aged 21 to 30.

Focus on Frequent Visitors: Tailor marketing strategies to target individuals who frequently visit coffee houses and bars, as they are more likely to accept coupons.

Family-Friendly Offers: Develop family-friendly promotions or offers that cater to drivers with children, potentially increasing acceptance rates among this group.

Morning Promotions: Consider offering coffee house coupons in the morning to capitalize on higher acceptance rates at this time.

Temperature-Based Promotions: Leverage warmer weather to promote coffee house and bar coupons, as higher temperatures seem to correlate with increased acceptance.

Income-Based Promotions: Consider offering additional incentives or discounts to lower-income groups to further increase coupon acceptance rates.
